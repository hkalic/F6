All in one "shortcut" to the ERP system

Back in the company I worked, this app was The main utility for search/display/print/export from our Big ERP. 
Need data to be mined? Just give me table with products and the rest is history. People still ask me if I can make them something like this.

Also credits for this project goes to my co-author Domino.

PS: 
- this is old project made with Delphi
- it won't work without BDE installed
- don't ask for VCLs
